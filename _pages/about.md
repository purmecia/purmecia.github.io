    <h1>Hey! Welcome to my page!</h1>
</div>

I'm a second-year M.S. student of Computer Science at Duke University. My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jennifer Groh](https://people.duke.edu/~jmgroh/) at Duke University.

You can find my CV here: [link](../assets/CV_YuchenCao.pdf).
