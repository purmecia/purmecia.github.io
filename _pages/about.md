I'm a now second-year M.S. student of Computer Science at Duke University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jennifer Groh](https://people.duke.edu/~jmgroh/). Before coming to Duke, I got my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT).

You can find my CV here: [link](../assets/CV_YuchenCao.pdf).

[Email](mailto:im.yuchen.cao@duke.edu) / [Github](https://github.com/purmecia) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuchencaoduke/) 

My research interest lies in integrating **hardware and software** in both **computer science** and **brain science**. To be specific, I am interested in this fantastic and extensive area:

- **From computer science to brain science**: High-dimensional data analysis, Computational neuroscience, Brain network
- **From brain science to computer science**: Bio-inspired AI, Neural network analysis, etc.
- **Overlap**: Brain-computer interface, illusion in machine, reinforcement learning, consciousness
