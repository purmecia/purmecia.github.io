I'm a now second-year **M.S.** student of **Computer Science** at **Duke University**, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jennifer Groh](https://people.duke.edu/~jmgroh/). Before, I got my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT), where I won tens of awards in programming competitions including a **silver medal** in **ACM-ICPC** and **champion in RoboCup**.

You can find my CV here: [link](../assets/CV_YuchenCao.pdf)

[Email](mailto:im.yuchen.cao@duke.edu) / [Github](https://github.com/purmecia) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuchencaoduke/) 

My research interest lies in integrating **hardware and software** in both **computer science** and **brain science**. To be specific, I am interested (but not confined)  in these fantastic and extensive areas:

- **From computer science to brain science**: High-dimensional data analysis, Computational neuroscience, Brain network, etc.
- **From brain science to computer science**: Bio-inspired computation, Neural Symbolic Machine Learning, Neural network analysis, etc.
- **Overlap**: Brain-computer interface, Illusion in machine, Reinforcement learning, Machine learning, Robotics, Multi-modal perception, Consciousness, etc.
